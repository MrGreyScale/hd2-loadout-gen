# hd2-loadout-gen
Tired of running the same loadouts? Look no further than this loadout generator. Upon running, it will generate:
- a primary
- a secondary
- a throwable
- armour type
- armour passive

In the .zip file, there will be a file named "selections.csv" with all weapons/armours in the game at the moment. If there is something you don't want in the randomizer, remove the X from the row. If you want to add something back to the randomizer, put an "X" (not an "x") where the two commas are. I will provide an example of what a selected/deselected weapon would look like. 

SELECTED:
Primary,AR,AR-23 Liberator,X,

DESELECTED:
Primary,AR,AR-23 Liberator,,
